Have you ever noticed how some words read the same forwards and backwards, like "noon" or "radar". These are known as [palindromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)!

Let's create an ``isPalindrome()`` function that does the following:

It accepts a word string as a parameter.
The function returns ``true`` if the word is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns ``false``.

Note: If there are any capital letters in ``word``, use ``word.toLowerCase()`` to make it all lowercase. More info about this method here.

After defining this function, go ahead and call it a few times on some words to see the results! Here are some words to try out:

- "racecar"
- "madam"
- "moonlight"
- "aviary"
