Let's practice defining functions by making a countdown timer!

Define a ``countdown()`` function with the ``function`` keyword. Then, let's add the following to the function body:

- A loop that iterates down from that 10 to 1.
- Inside the loop, print the current number.
- Outside the loop, return the string "Blast Off! ðŸš€"
  
Lastly, call the ``countdown()`` function and remember to log it to the console!
