Let's practice adding and updating properties with the following ``pokemon`` object:
```
pokemon = {
  name: "Pikachu",
  type: "Electric ⚡️",
  level: 25,
}
```
First, define a new ``.isCaught`` property with a value of ``false``.

Next, log the ``pokemon`` object to ensure the new property was added.

Yay! You caught the Pokémon! Let's change the following properties:

- Change ``.isCaught`` to ``true``.
- Nickname your newly caught Pokémon by changing the value of ``name``.

Finally, log the updated ``pokemon`` object to the console.
