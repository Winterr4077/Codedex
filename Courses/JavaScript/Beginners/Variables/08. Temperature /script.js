JavaScript has the following arithmetic operators:

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulo (returns the remainder)
** Exponent (covered in the next exercise) 

The following code calculates a 20% tip by adding the total price of a pizza and coke, and then multiplying by a decimal number (also known as a float):

const pizza = 2.99;
const coke = 0.99;

let total = pizza + coke;

let tip = total * 0.2;

console.log(tip);     Output: 0.796 

Instructions

Let's put these operators to use!

Create a temperature.js program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit (Â°F) to Celsius (Â°C).

Google the current temperature of Brooklyn, NY (where CodÃ©dex is based) in Â°F.

Use the following formula and write it out in JavaScript:


Celsius=(Fahrenheitâˆ’32)
            1.8
â€‹


Print out the converted temperature using console.log().

Currently : 29Â°C or 85Â°F
*/

let tempretureF = 85;

tempretureC = (tempretureF - 32) / 1.8;

console.log(tempretureC);
