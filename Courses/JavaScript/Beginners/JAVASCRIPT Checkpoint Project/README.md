[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies.

Though this prompt may appear simple to experienced web developers, it is designed to weed out 90% of the job candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively. Want to give it a try?

Here is how the game works: We count from 1 to a given number ("1, 2, 3, ..."):

- If the next number is a multiple of 3, we say "Fizz".
- If the next number is a multiple of 5, we say "Buzz".
- If the next number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, we say "FizzBuzz"!
  
Using everything we've learned thus far, let's write a JavaScript program to mimic this game. The output for numbers 1 through 15 should look like this:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
We will give you one hint: you will need to use the ``%``modulo operator for this!
