Let's go to the farm! Look at all the animals! 🧑‍🌾

For this exercise, create three objects for three farm animals: ``pig``, ``sheep``, and ``dog``.

Each object should have the following properties:

- A ``.name``, set to a string.
- A ``.type``, set to a string of either "pig", "sheep", or "dog".
- An ``.age``, set to an integer.
- A ``.makeSound()`` method that returns a string of the sound it makes (specific to the animal).
  
The ``.makeSound()`` method should return a string featuring the other properties, and looks like the following:

``Benny is a 10 year old dog that goes woof!``
