[Sign Bunny](https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6331753/sign-bunny-meme-explained) is a Twitter meme featuring an ASCII art rabbit holding a sign. 🐰

In this final exercise, you are going to create a sign bunny with C++.

Use ``std::cout`` statements to output:
```
|￣￣￣￣￣￣￣|
|   MESSAGE  |
|    HERE    |
|____________|
(\__/) ||
(•ㅅ•) ||
/ 　 づ
```
- Start with a comment with today’s date.
- Use multiple ``std::cout`` to produce this art.
- Add a little message for the world!

When you are done, click “Run”, take a screenshot of your program, click the Twitter icon, and share your sign bunny!
