Let's practice with fonts!

In an index.html file, copy and paste the following:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <title>Five Families</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      <!-- Place text here. -->
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
Next, replace the comment with some text. This can be anything you want. It can be as simple as your name, a few sentences, etc.

Then, inside a styles.css file, select the <p> paragraph element and assign it the following:

- A font-family property with a member of one of the five families (don't forget a fallback font).
- A font-size property; feel free to use either absolute units or relative units!
Save the files and open index.html to see what the rendered result looks like.

Bonus: Try experimenting with different font families and incorporate the font-weight property, as well.
