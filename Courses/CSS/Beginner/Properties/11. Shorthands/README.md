Letâ€™s practice using shorthands!

Copy and paste the following HTML into the index.html file:
```
<h1>Favorite Song</h1>
<p><!-- Favorite song/artist here. --></p>
```
Go ahead and replace the HTML comment with your favorite song and artist!

Next, paste the following in the styles.css file:
```
h1 {

}

p {

}
```
1. For the h1 heading element, add a shorthand border property that includes values for width, style, and color.
2. For the p paragraph element, let's add a shorthand font property with values for the size, weight, and font-family.
Note: No matter which font-family you choose, always remember to include a fallback font like sans-serif or cursive!
