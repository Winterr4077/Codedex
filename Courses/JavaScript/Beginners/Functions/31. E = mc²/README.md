In 1905, renowned scientist Albert Einstein changed the world of physics with his [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity). It transformed how we understand the relationship between space, time, and energy.

The most notable equation to come out of this theory was the following:

``E=mc*2``
 
The E stands for "Energy", which is the product of the following:
- m for mass, usually measured in kilograms (kg).
- c*2 is the speed of light multiplied by itself.
  
Let's write a function called ``relativityTheory()``.

It should accept a single ``mass`` parameter that is an integer or decimal number.

Afterward, call the ``relativityTheory()`` function with a ``mass`` argument.
