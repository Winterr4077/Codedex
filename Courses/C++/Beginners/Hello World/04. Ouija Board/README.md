The [Ouija Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija) is a flat wood marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0-9, and the words "yes" and "no". It was believed that the dead can contact the living through it. ðŸ‘»

Create an ouija.cpp program that displays a Ouija Board.

First, start your program with a comment about the rules of the game.

Then use ``std::cout`` statements to output:
```
----------------------------------
|          x YES   NO x          |
|                                |
|         ABCDEFGHIJKLM          |
|         NOPQRSTUVWXYZ          |
|                                |
|           1234567890           |
