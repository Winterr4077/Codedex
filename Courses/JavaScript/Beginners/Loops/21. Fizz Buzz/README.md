Though this challenge may appear simple to experienced coders, it is designed to weed out 90% of job candidates who cannot apply their coding knowledge to a new problem creatively. Want to give it a try?

Create a fizz_buzz.py program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

Here's the catch:

- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- Here's the tricky part: For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

The output should look like:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...
```
Btw, it's totally okay if you can't get this one... it's a tough problem! Take a look at the hint and the solution before moving forward to the Checkpoint Project! ‚õ≥Ô∏è
