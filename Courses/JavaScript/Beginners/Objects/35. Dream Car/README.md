Let's use object properties and dot notation to design your dream car! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

First, create a new car object:

``const car = { };``

Then, use dot notation to add the following properties:

- A ``.model`` (string) property, such as "Tesla" or "Honda".
- A ``.year`` (integer) property for when the car was made.
- A ``.color`` (string) property of the car.
- A ``.used`` (boolean) property that can either be ``true`` or ``false``.
  
Lastly, log a string message to the console that includes the properties you defined for the ``car`` object:

``I'm looking for a 2024 Honda that is used.``

If the ``.used`` property is ``false``, the message should say the following:

``I'm looking for a 2024 Honda that is new.``
