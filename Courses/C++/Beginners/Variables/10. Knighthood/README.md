Knighthood is an honorary title given for service to the country, church, or monarch. It's one of the highest honors one can receive.

Let's create the knighthood speech given in Game of Thrones.

Declare a variable called ``name`` with your name inside:

``std::string name = "Brianne";``

Output the following using chaining:

> "In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.  
> In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.  
> In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.  
> Arise, [name], a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."

But use ``name`` in the fourth sentence! 🗡️
