Let's use array bracket notation to customize a list for a trip to the grocery store!

Copy and paste the following array into an index.js file:
```
let groceryList = ["🥛 Milk", "🥑 Avocado", "🥚 Eggs", "🍞 Bread"];
```
It looks like we actually don't need eggs! But we do need butter and laundry soap!

Use bracket notation to:

Replace ``"🥚 Eggs"`` with ``"🧈 Butter"``.
Add ``"🧼 Laundry soap"`` to the end of the ``groceryList`` array.
Finally, log the updated ``groceryList`` array to the console.
