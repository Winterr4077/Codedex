Let's apply some ``sticky`` styles to the tutorial site!

Go to the styles.css file. First, remove or comment out the entire ``main`` selector.

Then, add ``position: sticky``; to the ``header`` and ``section > h2`` selectors.

In ``header``, make sure the ``top``, ``width,`` and ``z-index`` properties are still the same.

Add a ``top`` property of ``133px`` to the ``section > h2`` selector.

If you refresh the page, and scroll from the top, you may notice the section headers "Our Story" and "Services" stick towards the top of the page.
