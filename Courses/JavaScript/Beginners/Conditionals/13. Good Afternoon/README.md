Go back to your ``if`` statement from the previous exercise and turn it into an ``if/else`` for the following:

If ``hour`` < 12, then print “Good morning 🌞” and some of your morning routines.
Else, print “Good afternoon ☁️” and some of your afternoon rituals.
After you run the code, change hour's value and run it again. Do this a few times to make sure the program is working as intended.
