Let's go back to the ``#notification-div`` element and change its ``position`` from ``relative`` to ``absolute``.

Make sure to leave the other styles for the ``top`` and ``left``.

The notification should now be near the top of the page, towards the middle.

Then, in the ``header`` selector, give it an ``absolute`` position along with a ``width`` of ``100%``.

Lastly, create a new selector for the ``main`` element, and give it a ``relative`` positioning along with a ``top`` of ``133px``.
