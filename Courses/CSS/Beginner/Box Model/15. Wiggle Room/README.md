We'll continue building our mini-app by adding padding!

Let's add some ``padding`` styles by doing the following in the styles.css file:

- Select just the ``#post-list`` element and add a ``padding-right`` value of ``40px``.
- Select all elements with a ``.post-wrapper`` class and add ``50px`` of padding to the top, right, and left sides (but none on the bottom).

Save the styles.css file and select "Run" to see the padding added around the image.
