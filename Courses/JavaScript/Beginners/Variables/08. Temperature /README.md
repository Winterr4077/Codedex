Let's put these operators to use!

Create a **temperature.js** program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C).

Google the current temperature of [Brooklyn, NY](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=brooklyn%20temperature) (where Codédex is based) in °F.

Use the following formula and write it out in JavaScript:

Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8

Print out the converted temperature using `console.log()`.
