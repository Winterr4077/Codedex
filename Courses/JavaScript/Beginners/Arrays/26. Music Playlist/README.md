It's time to put these methods to the test by customizing a music playlist! ðŸŽµ

Inside an index.js file, copy and paste the following array:
```
const musicPlaylist = [
  "Tom Sawyer",
  "Sabotage",
  "I Wanna Dance With Somebody",
  "Don't Speak",
  "Bulls On Parade",
  "Thriller",
  "The Breaks",
  "Brick",
  "Aeroplane Over the Sea",
  "Tubthumping"
];
```
Next, let's do the following:

- Remove the first and last elements.
- Add one new element to end of the array.
- Add two new elements to the beginning of the array.
  
Afterward, log your updated ``musicPlaylist`` array to the console!
