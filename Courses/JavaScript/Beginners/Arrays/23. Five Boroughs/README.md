New York City is made of [five boroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City#:~:text=New%20York%20City%2C%20the%20most,Queens%20County%20and%20Bronx%20County.) that are filled with lots of fun destinations!

Let's say we're planning a trip to NYC and we want to visit at least one place from each of the five boroughs:

"🗽 Manhattan - Washington Square Park"
"🏟️ The Bronx - Yankee Stadium"
"🎡 Brooklyn - Coney Island"
"🧧 Queens - Flushing"
"🌉 Staten Island - Historic Richmond Town"
We can store all of this information in an array!

Copy and paste the following into the editor:

let myDestinations = [
  "🗽 Manhattan - Washington Square Park",
  "🏟️ The Bronx - Yankee Stadium",
  "🎡 Brooklyn - Coney Island",
  "🧧 Queens - Flushing",
  "🌉 Staten Island - Historic Richmond Town"
];

console.log(myDestinations);

Run the program to see the array appear in the console!
