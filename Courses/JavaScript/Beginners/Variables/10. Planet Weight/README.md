Create a weight conversion program that:

Takes your weight on Earth.
Converts it to your weight on either the moon or Mars.
To calculate your weight on Mars:


destination_weight=earth_weightÃ—0.38

The output of the program should look like this:

Your weight on Earth is 210 pounds.
Your weight on Mars is 79.8 pounds.

Once you are done, post a screenshot of your code to Twitter by clicking the icon below, and then go to #CodedexPlanetWeight to review another learner's work. Be supportive! :)
