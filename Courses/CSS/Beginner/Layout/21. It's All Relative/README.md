With the ``#notification-div`` placed just after the opening ``<main>`` tag, go to the styles.css file and set its ``position`` property to ``relative``.

Then, let's move the element away from where it would normally be by adding a ``top`` of ``10px`` and a ``left`` of ``5%``. Select the "Run" button to re-render the page and move the element.

Next, either copy/paste or move the ``#notification-div`` element to another valid place inside the index.html (like inside one of the ``<section>`` elements).

Select "Run" again to observe how the element is moved relative to the position of its containing parent element.
