Create a blank letter.py program.

In this exercise, you will write a letter to your future self... in Python.

Take a moment and think about what you hope to achieve on this journey.

Use ``print()`` to output:

- Today's date.
- How you are feeling right now.
- What you want to accomplish by learning to code.
- A message to your older, wiser, and programmer self.
- Your favorite emoji to spice things up!
When it's done, take a screenshot and click the Twitter icon to post your letter!

P.S. We will return the letter when the time is right. ðŸ˜Š
