Let's practice using arrays with loops by reciting our [times tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table)!

Many teachers believe that you should memorize a 9 x 9 table (i.e., ``9 x 0`` through ``9 x 9``).

Inside an index.js file, create the following variables:

- A ``multiple`` variable that should be set to an integer above 0.
- A ``numbers`` array of integers 0 through 9.

Then, use a ``for`` loop to iterate through the ``numbers`` array and multiply a given number by ``multiple`` each time. Then, print the results to the console.

If you chose 9 for your ``multiple``, the output should look like this:
```
9 x 0 = 0
9 x 1 = 9
9 x 2 = 18
9 x 3 = 27
9 x 4 = 36
9 x 5 = 45
9 x 6 = 54
9 x 7 = 63
9 x 8 = 72
9 x 9 = 81
```
