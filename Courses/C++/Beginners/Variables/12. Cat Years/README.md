Have you wondered how old your cat is when they are older? Your furry friend might be cute and small, but they are older than you realize! 🐱

To put it into perspective: The first two cat years count as 24 human years (the first year = 15 human years, the second year = 9 human years).

Each additional cat year counts as 4 human years.

Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their cat's age and then calculate the equivalent human age right meow.

``humanYears = (catAge - 2) * 4 + 24;``

It should look something like:
```
Welcome to the Cat Years program! This only works for cats older than 2 years old.

Enter your cat's age: 4
Your cat is 32 years old in human years.
```
This equation work for any cat that's 3+ years old.
