Uh-oh! Looks like we have an error. Let's fix it!

Select the 📂 folder icon to open the file tree.

Find the **index.html** file and paste the following in the ``<body>`` element:

``<div id="root"></div>``

Then, go to the index.js file and pass the ``container`` variable to the ``createRoot()`` function.

Notice what appears on the output window!
