First, go ahead and start a new index.html file. Then, copy and paste the following:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="invite-wrapper">
      <h1>You're Invited!</h1>
      <div id="invite-text">

      <p id="itinerary">
        Date: <br />
        Time: <br />
        Location: <br />
        RSVP by <span><!-- DATE HERE --></span> to let us know you'll be joining!
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <span><!-- YOUR NAME --></span>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
For the HTML comments in the ``<span>`` elements, replace them with the date of the event and your name.

Next, go ahead and create a new styles.css file.

Be as creative as you want with the fonts and colors, but make sure to do the following:

1. Select ``#invite-wrapper``:
- Assign a ``width`` that uses a percentage in the ``25%``-``75%`` range.
- Set the ``padding`` property to ``25px``.
- Add a ``background-color`` that uses either ``rgb()`` or hexadecimals.
- Color the text with a ``color`` property that uses either ``rgb()`` or hexadecimals.
2. Select h1:
- Give this a ``font-family`` property that has at least one desired font and one backup font (from one of the five font families).
- Align the text in the center with the ``text-align`` property.
3. Select ``#invite-text`` and give it a ``width`` between ``75%`` and ``90%``.
4. Select ``#itinerary`` and align its text in the center.
When finished, feel free to screenshot your invitation and Tweet it with the button below!
